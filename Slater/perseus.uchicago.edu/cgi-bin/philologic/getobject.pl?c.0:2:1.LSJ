 <span class=head>Postscript 1940</span>
 
 
<p>The Delegates of the Oxford University Press, in issuing the tenth and last part of
 the revised edition of Liddell and Scott's Greek Lexicon, wish to express their deep
 gratitude to all who have assisted in carrying this undertaking to a conclusion. They
 greatly regret that neither the Editor Sir Henry Stuart Jones, who died on 29 June 1939,
 nor the Assistant Editor Mr. Roderick McKenzie, who died on 24 June 1937, survived to
 see the work completed. McKenzie saw the main body of the work to its end, and himself
 wrote the long article on <span class=foreign>ὡς</span>; Sir Henry was at work on the Addenda and Corrigenda up
 to within a fortnight of his death and had almost put them into shape. The work done by
 these two men could not be overrated. Sir Henry was the ideal Editor; his wide range
 of knowledge and his exact scholarship, his persistent devotion to his task even in periods
 of ill health, his tactful assiduity in consulting experts and his skill in co-ordinating their
 results, gave the work at once its consistency and its elasticity. McKenzie, to whom fell
 the arrangement, in their ultimate form, of most of the articles, provided a fine complement;
 his great knowledge of comparative philology, his laborious accuracy, and his tireless
 patience, gave his contribution inestimable value.
 </p>
 
<p>In the Preface published in 1925 Stuart Jones sketched the history of the work up to
 the publication of <span class=foreign>ἀποβαίνω</span>, and recorded the signal services given by many scholars to the
 work in its formative stages. To that nothing need now be added. But Jones went on to
 thank the scholars who were ' generously devoting their time to the reading of proof-sheets
 and the verification of references'. It is important that the nature of this work should be
 understood. The procedure adopted, when work was resumed after the Four Years' War,
 was this: McKenzie wrote out Jones's corrections on a 'paste-up' of the previous edition.
 This was the 'copy'; and fresh material was to some extent incorporated in it from time
 to time. But as succeeding sections of the alphabet were revised and set up in type, proofs
 were sent to the volunteer helpers, whose labours, in the event, went far beyond mere
 verification; in their hands and the editors' the work was very largely recast. The method
 has obvious advantages, and the peculiar excellences of the revised lexicon owe much to
 its adoption. But inevitably it prolonged the process of gestation. The period of publication,
 1925-40, was actually longer than the period of copy-writing, 1911-24, even although
 the earlier period was interrupted by the war, and in the later period there were two
 editors instead of one.
 </p>
 
<p>Of those who were named in the original Preface as having embarked on the labour of
 proof-reading, some are dead: notably Sir William T. Thiselton-Dyer, A. C. Pearson, and
 Herbert Greene.<span class=generalnote>Greene's notebooks (see the 1925 Preface, p. x) are in the Bodleian.</span> Others have lived to see the work to its end. These, and not these
 alone, have more than doubled the debt of gratitude which, fifteen years ago, Jones could
 not 'find words adequate to express'.
 </p>
 
<p>Unhappily neither editor lived to prepare a final list of acknowledgements. McKenzie
 died suddenly in 1937. Jones, though he lived to see the end in sight, left no material for
 the brief 'epilogue' which it had been agreed he should furnish. It would be impossible
 now to produce a complete or balanced account of the labours of the proof-readers and
 verifiers without undertaking inquiries which the circumstances of the time make difficult.
 The list which follows does not attempt discrimination. Special mention must, however,
 be made of the prolonged and arduous labours of Mr. M. N. Tod of Oriel College on the
 inscriptions; of Lt.-Col. A. S. L. Farquharson of University College on Plato and Aristotle;
 
 <p><center> -- xiv -- </center><p>
 
 of Dr. E. T. Withington of Balliol College on the medical writers; of Sir D'Arcy Thompson
 of St. Andrews on natural history; and of the late Sir Thomas Heath on mathematics and
 astrology.
 </p>
 
<p>The proofs were read also, in whole or in part, by the following: Mr. P. V. M. Benecke
  of Magdalen College; Mr. F. H. Colson of St. John's College, Cambridge; Mr. Christopher
  Cookson of Magdalen College; Prof. E. S. Forster of Sheffield University; Mr. E. T. D.
  Jenkins of University College, Aberystwyth; Mr. Edgar Lobel of the Queen's College;
  Mr. W. L. Lorimer of St. Andrews; Prof. J. F. Mountford of Liverpool University;
  Mr. Maurice Platnauer of Brasenose College; Sir David Ross, Provost of Oriel College;
  Prof. A. E. Taylor of Edinburgh; and by the late F. W. Hall, A. E. Housman, A. C. Pearson,
  J. A. Smith, and J. L. Stocks. As press reader from the beginning of the work Mr.
  T. Bruce has made a special contribution to its accuracy.
 </p>
 
<p>The Addenda and Corrigenda issued with the several parts have been greatly enlarged,
  and are now consolidated in a single list. Of these, the proofs were read by Dr. H. Idris
  Bell of the British Museum, Prof. G. R. Driver of Magdalen College, and Prof. Paul Maas
  of Königsberg, as well as by some of those who have been named above.
 </p>
 
<p>The Addenda owe much to the reviews and private communications of Dr. Ernest
  Harrison of Trinity College, Cambridge; of Prof. Maas; of Prof. R. Pfeiffer of Munich (it
  is noted with pleasure that both Prof. Maas and Prof. Pfeiffer are now resident in Oxford);
  of Prof. K. Latte of Hamburg; of Prof. W. Schmid of Tübingen; of Herr Pfarrer P. Katz
  of Coblenz, and of many other scholars.
 </p>
 
<p>Both in the Addenda and in the main work the principle of anonymity has been applied to
  original contributions that appear first in the Lexicon, and it was the intention of the Editors
  that those who made them should be free at any later time to claim their own discoveries.
 </p>
 
<p>Miss Margaret Alford, who bears an honoured name, helped Sir Henry Stuart Jones
  in the compilation of the Addenda, and since his death, with the collaboration of Professor
  Maas in the final stages, has performed the laborious duty of preparing the Addenda for
  Part 10 and of correcting proofs of the whole.
 </p>
 
<p>It is impossible now, as it was impossible in 1925, to name all who have contributed to
  the improvement of the great lexicon. The sacrifice of leisure, and the devotion to Greek
  learning, of which Jones then wrote, have been nobly sustained by a generation of scholars,
  and the monument of unselfish industry is at last complete.
